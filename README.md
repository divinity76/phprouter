# phprouter
php router
api inspried by https://github.com/bramus/router
but this router is not affected by https://github.com/bramus/router/issues/137 ... which is why i made this router

#installation
the router is just a standalone .php file, you can just copypaste it. 
another alternative is to use composer:
```
composer require 'divinity76/phprouter'
```
